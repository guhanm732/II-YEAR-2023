"","Name","Year","Director","Hero","Review"
"1","Dr. No","(1962)","Terence Young","Sean Connery","Critics Consensus: Featuring plenty of the humor, action, and escapist thrills the series would become known for, Dr. No kicks off the Bond franchise in style."
"2","From Russia With Love","(1963)","Terence Young","Sean Connery","Critics Consensus: The second James Bond film, From Russia with Love is a razor-sharp, briskly-paced Cold War thriller that features several electrifying action scenes."
"3","007: Goldfinger","(1964)","Guy Hamilton","Sean Connery","Critics Consensus: Goldfinger is where James Bond as we know him comes into focus - it features one of 007's most famous lines (""A martini. Shaken, not stirred."") and a wide range of gadgets that would become the series' trademark."
"4","Thunderball","(1965)","Terence Young","Sean Connery","Critics Consensus: Lavishly rendered set pieces and Sean Connery's enduring charm make Thunderball a big, fun adventure, even if it doesn't quite measure up to the series' previous heights."
"5","007 - You Only Live Twice","(1967)","Lewis Gilbert","Sean Connery","Critics Consensus: With exotic locales, impressive special effects, and a worthy central villain, You Only Live Twice overcomes a messy and implausible story to deliver another memorable early Bond flick."
"6","Casino Royale","(1967)","Val Guest","Peter Sellers","Critics Consensus: A goofy, dated parody of spy movie clich√©s, Casino Royale squanders its all-star cast on a meandering, mostly laugh-free script."
"7","007 On Her Majesty's Secret Service","(1969)","Peter Hunt","George Lazenby","Critics Consensus: George Lazenby's only appearance as 007 is a fine entry in the series, featuring one of the most intriguing Bond girls in Tracy di Vincenzo (Diana Rigg), breathtaking visuals, and some great ski chases."
"8","Diamonds Are Forever","(1971)","Guy Hamilton","Sean Connery","Critics Consensus: Diamonds are Forever is a largely derivative affair, but it's still pretty entertaining nonetheless, thanks to great stunts, witty dialogue, and the presence of Sean Connery."
"9","Live and Let Die","(1973)","Guy Hamilton","Roger Moore","Critics Consensus: While not one of the highest-rated Bond films, Live and Let Die finds Roger Moore adding his stamp to the series with flashes of style and an improved sense of humor."
"10","The Man With the Golden Gun","(1974)","Guy Hamilton","Roger Moore","Critics Consensus: A middling Bond film, The Man With the Golden Gun suffers from double entendre-laden dialogue, a noteworthy lack of gadgets, and a villain that overshadows 007."
"11","The Spy Who Loved Me","(1977)","Lewis Gilbert","Roger Moore","Critics Consensus: Though it hints at the absurdity to come in later installments, The Spy Who Loved Me's sleek style, menacing villains, and sly wit make it the best of the Roger Moore era."
"12","Moonraker","(1979)","Lewis Gilbert","Roger Moore","Critics Consensus: Featuring one of the series' more ludicrous plots but outfitted with primo gadgets and spectacular sets, Moonraker is both silly and entertaining."
"13","For Your Eyes Only","(1981)","John Glen","Roger Moore","Critics Consensus: For Your Eyes Only trades in some of the outlandish Bond staples for a more sober outing, and the result is a satisfying adventure, albeit without some of the bombastic thrills fans may be looking for."
"14","Octopussy","(1983)","John Glen","Roger Moore","Critics Consensus: Despite a couple of electrifying action sequences, Octopussy is a formulaic, anachronistic Bond outing."
"15","Never Say Never Again","(1983)","Irvin Kershner","Sean Connery","Critics Consensus: While the rehashed story feels rather uninspired and unnecessary, the return of both Sean Connery and a more understated Bond make Never Say Never Again a watchable retread."
"16","A View to a Kill","(1985)","John Glen","Roger Moore","Critics Consensus: Absurd even by Bond standards, A View to a Kill is weighted down by campy jokes and a noticeable lack of energy."
"17","The Living Daylights","(1987)","John Glen","Timothy Dalton","Critics Consensus: Newcomer Timothy Dalton plays James Bond with more seriousness than preceding installments, and the result is exciting and colorful but occasionally humorless."
"18","Licence to Kill","(1989)","John Glen","Timothy Dalton","Critics Consensus: License to Kill is darker than many of the other Bond entries, with Timothy Dalton playing the character with intensity, but it still has some solid chases and fight scenes."
"19","GoldenEye","(1995)","Martin Campbell","Pierce Brosnan","Critics Consensus: The first and best Pierce Brosnan Bond film, GoldenEye brings the series into a more modern context, and the result is a 007 entry that's high-tech, action-packed, and urbane."
"20","Tomorrow Never Dies","(1997)","Roger Spottiswoode","Pierce Brosnan","Critics Consensus: A competent, if sometimes by-the-numbers entry to the 007 franchise, Tomorrow Never Dies may not boast the most original plot but its action sequences are genuinely thrilling."
"21","The World Is Not Enough","(1999)","Michael Apted","Pierce Brosnan","Critics Consensus: Plagued by mediocre writing, uneven acting, and a fairly by-the-numbers plot, The World Is Not Enough is partially saved by some entertaining and truly Bond-worthy action sequences."
"22","Die Another Day","(2002)","Lee Tamahori","Pierce Brosnan","Critics Consensus: Its action may be bit too over-the-top for some, but Die Another Day is lavishly crafted and succeeds in evoking classic Bond themes from the franchise's earlier installments."
"23","Casino Royale","(2006)","Martin Campbell","Daniel Craig","Critics Consensus: Casino Royale disposes of the silliness and gadgetry that plagued recent James Bond outings, and Daniel Craig delivers what fans and critics have been waiting for: a caustic, haunted, intense reinvention of 007."
"24","Quantum of Solace","(2008)","Marc Forster","Daniel Craig","Critics Consensus: Brutal and breathless, Quantum Of Solace delivers tender emotions along with frenetic action, but coming on the heels of Casino Royale, it's still a bit of a disappointment."
"25","Skyfall","(2012)","Sam Mendes","Daniel Craig","Critics Consensus: Sam Mendes brings Bond surging back with a smart, sexy, riveting action thriller that qualifies as one of the best 007 films to date."
"26","Spectre","(2015)","Sam Mendes","Daniel Craig","Critics Consensus: Spectre nudges Daniel Craig's rebooted Bond closer to the glorious, action-driven spectacle of earlier entries, although it's admittedly reliant on established 007 formula."
"27","No Time to Die","(2021)","Cary Joji Fukunaga","Daniel Craig","Critics Consensus: It isn't the sleekest or most daring 007 adventure, but No Time to Die concludes Daniel Craig's franchise tenure in satisfying style."
